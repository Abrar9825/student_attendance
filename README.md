# 🎓 Student Attendance System 📊

Welcome to the Student Attendance System project! This application is designed to streamline the process of taking and managing student attendance. Faculty members can create sessions with a set limit on the number of students, ensuring that only the allotted number can mark their attendance. The system uses OTP verification for secure attendance marking and allows faculty to download the attendance sheet in XLSX format.

## Features ✨

- **Session Creation**: Faculty can create attendance sessions with a predefined student limit.
- **OTP Verification**: Students mark their attendance securely using OTP.
- **Attendance Sheet Download**: Faculty can download the attendance sheet in XLSX format for easy record-keeping and analysis.

## How It Works 🛠️

1. **Faculty Session Creation**: Faculty members create an attendance session specifying the maximum number of students allowed.
2. **Student Attendance**: Students mark their attendance by entering an OTP provided for the session.
3. **Download Attendance Sheet**: Once the session is over, faculty can download the attendance records in an XLSX file.
